Particular focus was placed on notable platforms such as Thingworx, Mendix, and OutSystems, with the ultimate goal of identifying the best solution for a wide range of application scenarios, from simple Excel alternatives to complex applications.\nThe project\u0026rsquo;s primary objective was to enable Citizen Developers to create their own applications, while simultaneously improving the productivity of professional developers by leveraging Low-Code technology and integrated deployment pipelines. These pipelines allow developers to build and release applications directly—eliminating additional deployment steps.\nSolution # To further boost collaboration and productivity, pre-built templates were developed and integrated, allowing for rapid sharing of application concepts within teams. Additionally, the platform was designed to adhere to corporate-specific design guidelines, ensuring a consistent and user-friendly interface. Key actions included:\nMinimum Viable Product (MVP) Rollout: The MVP was deployed in a test environment with 50 test users. Infrastructure and External Data Sources: Integration with external data sources such as SAP and various databases was successfully executed. Scalability Tests: Extensive scalability testing was conducted to ensure the platform is future-proof and can adapt to growing demand. Support and Role-based Access Control # An integral part of the project was the development of a comprehensive support concept, which included both a user-helping-user community as well as team support by developers. This support system enabled users to quickly resolve issues and assist each other. Additionally, an offshore team implemented a role-based authorization concept, efficiently managing user access and permissions. A workflow system was also integrated to simplify the management of user roles and access rights.\nChallenges and Scaling # Throughout the project, the user count grew faster than anticipated, leading to a temporary overload of the test system. This required a registration freeze to maintain system stability. To provide users with an easy onboarding process, a detailed training program was developed, supported by regular workshops for users.\nResults # The platform achieved remarkable success early after the rollout. The number of active users grew rapidly:\nDirectly after the test phase: 650 users. Shortly after the official launch: 1,100 active users. With an estimated efficiency increase of about 80%, we expect savings of approximately €4.2 million in the first year, based on the average development costs for 250 developers. Given the continually growing user base, these savings are projected to rise exponentially, leading to significant cost reductions and productivity gains for the company.\nConclusion # The Low-Code project was a pivotal step in the company\u0026rsquo;s digitalization and process optimization efforts. It empowers Citizen Developers to create applications across varying complexities while also freeing up professional developers by offering pre-built templates, automation, and integrated deployment pipelines. The project has not only driven substantial improvements in efficiency but also contributed to significant cost savings for the company.\n","date":"1 August 2022","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/en/success_stories/low_code/","section":"Success stories","summary":"By implementing a future-proof Low-Code platform, both professional developers and Citizen Developers were empowered to efficiently build applications.

Recognizing this need, I spearheaded the establishment of a Makerspace from the ground up, transforming an unused area into a dynamic hub of innovation and creativity.\nThe vision for the Makerspace was clear: to provide a dedicated environment where ideas could be transformed into tangible outcomes, particularly in the realm of educational and research-driven projects. One of the key milestones in this initiative was securing a free 3D printer, significantly enhancing our prototyping capabilities. This addition allowed for rapid experimentation and iteration, turning concepts into physical prototypes with unprecedented efficiency.\nTo further elevate the impact of the Makerspace, I established strategic collaborations with several universities, focusing particularly on the emerging fields of Augmented Reality (AR) and Virtual Reality (VR). These partnerships enriched our research and development efforts, providing access to cutting-edge knowledge and resources. The collaborative projects that emerged from these partnerships not only advanced our internal capabilities but also positioned our organization at the forefront of technological innovation.\nThe Makerspace quickly became a cornerstone of our innovation strategy, hosting major events such as hackathons that I organized. These events attracted a diverse community of inventors, problem-solvers, and tech enthusiasts, fostering a culture of collaboration and creative problem-solving within the organization.\nThe success of the Makerspace soon garnered attention beyond our immediate environment. Another international location recognized the value and impact of such a space and expressed a desire to replicate this success. Given my experience and the results achieved, I was entrusted with leading the planning and development of this new Makerspace.\nTaking the lead in this expansion, I applied the insights and best practices learned from the original Makerspace. The process involved not only replicating the foundational elements that made the first Makerspace successful but also tailoring the space to meet the unique needs and objectives of the new location. This included selecting appropriate technologies, establishing new collaborations with local universities, and creating a design that would foster innovation and collaboration in line with the specific goals of the new site.\nThrough meticulous planning and strategic execution, the second Makerspace was successfully launched, further extending our organization’s influence in the global innovation community. This expansion not only provided valuable resources and capabilities to the new location but also reinforced our reputation as a leader in technological innovation and collaboration on an international scale.\nThe creation and subsequent expansion of the Makerspace serve as a testament to the power of vision, leadership, and the strategic alignment of resources and partnerships. These efforts have not only provided tangible benefits to our organization but have also set a new standard for innovation spaces globally, establishing our organization as a pioneer in fostering creativity and technological advancement.\n","date":"17 July 2022","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/en/success_stories/makerspace/","section":"Success stories","summary":"Building Innovation: The Creation of a Makerspace and Its Impact on Technological Advancement","title":"Makerspace","type":"success_stories"},{"content":" A brief look at some projects of mine.
