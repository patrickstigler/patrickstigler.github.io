Recognizing this need, I spearheaded the establishment of a Makerspace from the ground up, transforming an unused area into a dynamic hub of innovation and creativity.\nThe vision for the Makerspace was clear: to provide a dedicated environment where ideas could be transformed into tangible outcomes, particularly in the realm of educational and research-driven projects. One of the key milestones in this initiative was securing a free 3D printer, significantly enhancing our prototyping capabilities. This addition allowed for rapid experimentation and iteration, turning concepts into physical prototypes with unprecedented efficiency.\nTo further elevate the impact of the Makerspace, I established strategic collaborations with several universities, focusing particularly on the emerging fields of Augmented Reality (AR) and Virtual Reality (VR). These partnerships enriched our research and development efforts, providing access to cutting-edge knowledge and resources. The collaborative projects that emerged from these partnerships not only advanced our internal capabilities but also positioned our organization at the forefront of technological innovation.\nThe Makerspace quickly became a cornerstone of our innovation strategy, hosting major events such as hackathons that I organized. These events attracted a diverse community of inventors, problem-solvers, and tech enthusiasts, fostering a culture of collaboration and creative problem-solving within the organization.\nThe success of the Makerspace soon garnered attention beyond our immediate environment. Another international location recognized the value and impact of such a space and expressed a desire to replicate this success. Given my experience and the results achieved, I was entrusted with leading the planning and development of this new Makerspace.\nTaking the lead in this expansion, I applied the insights and best practices learned from the original Makerspace. The process involved not only replicating the foundational elements that made the first Makerspace successful but also tailoring the space to meet the unique needs and objectives of the new location. This included selecting appropriate technologies, establishing new collaborations with local universities, and creating a design that would foster innovation and collaboration in line with the specific goals of the new site.\nThrough meticulous planning and strategic execution, the second Makerspace was successfully launched, further extending our organization’s influence in the global innovation community. This expansion not only provided valuable resources and capabilities to the new location but also reinforced our reputation as a leader in technological innovation and collaboration on an international scale.\nThe creation and subsequent expansion of the Makerspace serve as a testament to the power of vision, leadership, and the strategic alignment of resources and partnerships. These efforts have not only provided tangible benefits to our organization but have also set a new standard for innovation spaces globally, establishing our organization as a pioneer in fostering creativity and technological advancement.\n","date":"17 July 2022","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/en/success_stories/makerspace/","section":"Success stories","summary":"Building Innovation: The Creation of a Makerspace and Its Impact on Technological Advancement","title":"Makerspace","type":"success_stories"},{"content":" A brief look at some projects of mine.

From design to material selection and electronic integration—every detail is meticulously planned to ensure the ultimate driving experience.\nDesign and Construction The first step in developing a sim racing wheel is the design process, where Fusion 360 software plays a crucial role. This powerful tool allows for the creation of three-dimensional models of the wheel, enabling precise and efficient design. Throughout this project, significant proficiency in using Fusion 360 was acquired, forming the backbone of the entire construction process.\nMaterials: Carbon and Aluminum Only the highest quality materials were chosen for the wheel\u0026rsquo;s construction. The frame is made of carbon fiber, renowned for its lightness and exceptional strength. The buttons and shifters were crafted from aluminum, providing a durable and stylish solution. This combination of carbon and aluminum not only grants the wheel outstanding stability but also a premium aesthetic.\nErgonomics Through 3D Scanning Ergonomics is a central consideration in designing a sim racing wheel. To ensure optimal handling, the wheel\u0026rsquo;s ergonomic features were developed using 3D scanning technology. This technique allowed for the wheel to be shaped in a way that perfectly conforms to the driver’s hands, guaranteeing a comfortable and immersive driving experience.\nSoftware and Electronics Beyond the physical construction, integrating electronics and software is a crucial aspect of the project. The wheel’s controls were precisely programmed to ensure fast and reliable responses. The electronic components were carefully selected and integrated to provide seamless connectivity between the wheel and the simulation software.\nThus, building a sim racing wheel is more than just a technical project—it is a harmonious blend of design, materials science, ergonomics, and electronics. The expertise gained in Fusion 360 was pivotal to the project\u0026rsquo;s success, resulting in a custom-made wheel that meets the highest standards and delivers an exceptional driving experience.\n","date":"17 July 2022","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/en/projects/simracing-wheel/","section":"Projects","summary":"Building a sim racing wheel is a complex integration of design, high-quality materials, ergonomics, and precise electronics, resulting in a custom, exceptional driving experience, made possible by the expertise gained in Fusion 360.","title":"Simracing Wheel","type":"projects"},{"content":" A brief overview over some success stories of mine ","date":"17 July 2022","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/en/success_stories/","section":"Success stories","summary":"","title":"Success stories","type":"success_stories"},{"content":" Success Story at Robert Bosch GmbH, Stuttgart # In our pursuit of optimizing development processes, I led a comprehensive evaluation of the most prevalent low-code platforms available in the market.

As businesses grow, so does the complexity of their processes, making it essential to continuously evaluate and improve internal operations. One such process, the annual inventory count within the central purchasing department, recently came under scrutiny for its inefficiency.\nHistorically, the inventory counting process was a labor-intensive task. It required the collaboration of eight employees working full-time over a span of three weeks. This not only consumed significant human resources but also represented a substantial opportunity cost, as these employees were diverted from other critical tasks.\nRecognizing the inefficiency, I took the initiative to analyze and re-engineer the process. Through the development of a tailored script, I was able to transform the operation entirely. What once took weeks and considerable manpower could now be accomplished with a single click, completing the entire inventory count in just four minutes.\nThe impact of this improvement cannot be overstated. By reducing the time and resources required for inventory counting, we have not only increased productivity but also freed up valuable personnel to focus on other strategic initiatives. This change represents a significant leap forward in operational efficiency, showcasing the power of technology in streamlining business processes.\nThis case exemplifies the importance of continually reassessing and optimizing business operations. By leveraging automation and innovative problem-solving, companies can achieve remarkable gains in efficiency, ultimately contributing to a more agile and competitive organization.\n","date":"17 July 2021","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/en/success_stories/streamlined_process/","section":"Success stories","summary":"Streamlining Inventory Management: A Case Study in Efficiency Enhancement","title":"Streamlining Inventory Management","type":"success_stories"},{"content":" Success Story: LoRaWAN Technology Revolutionizes Sensor Monitoring in Facility Management # As the project lead for a strategic collaboration project with the Facility Management team, I was responsible for introducing the LoRaWAN standard across multiple locations in Germany.
