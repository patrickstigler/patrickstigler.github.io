Particular focus was placed on notable platforms such as Thingworx, Mendix, and OutSystems, with the ultimate goal of identifying the best solution for a wide range of application scenarios, from simple Excel alternatives to complex applications.\nThe project\u0026rsquo;s primary objective was to enable Citizen Developers to create their own applications, while simultaneously improving the productivity of professional developers by leveraging Low-Code technology and integrated deployment pipelines. These pipelines allow developers to build and release applications directly—eliminating additional deployment steps.\nSolution # To further boost collaboration and productivity, pre-built templates were developed and integrated, allowing for rapid sharing of application concepts within teams. Additionally, the platform was designed to adhere to corporate-specific design guidelines, ensuring a consistent and user-friendly interface. Key actions included:\nMinimum Viable Product (MVP) Rollout: The MVP was deployed in a test environment with 50 test users. Infrastructure and External Data Sources: Integration with external data sources such as SAP and various databases was successfully executed. Scalability Tests: Extensive scalability testing was conducted to ensure the platform is future-proof and can adapt to growing demand. Support and Role-based Access Control # An integral part of the project was the development of a comprehensive support concept, which included both a user-helping-user community as well as team support by developers. This support system enabled users to quickly resolve issues and assist each other. Additionally, an offshore team implemented a role-based authorization concept, efficiently managing user access and permissions. A workflow system was also integrated to simplify the management of user roles and access rights.\nChallenges and Scaling # Throughout the project, the user count grew faster than anticipated, leading to a temporary overload of the test system. This required a registration freeze to maintain system stability. To provide users with an easy onboarding process, a detailed training program was developed, supported by regular workshops for users.\nResults # The platform achieved remarkable success early after the rollout. The number of active users grew rapidly:\nDirectly after the test phase: 650 users. Shortly after the official launch: 1,100 active users. With an estimated efficiency increase of about 80%, we expect savings of approximately €4.2 million in the first year, based on the average development costs for 250 developers. Given the continually growing user base, these savings are projected to rise exponentially, leading to significant cost reductions and productivity gains for the company.\nConclusion # The Low-Code project was a pivotal step in the company\u0026rsquo;s digitalization and process optimization efforts. It empowers Citizen Developers to create applications across varying complexities while also freeing up professional developers by offering pre-built templates, automation, and integrated deployment pipelines. The project has not only driven substantial improvements in efficiency but also contributed to significant cost savings for the company.\n","date":"1 August 2022","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/en/success_stories/low_code/","section":"Success stories","summary":"By implementing a future-proof Low-Code platform, both professional developers and Citizen Developers were empowered to efficiently build applications.

As businesses grow, so does the complexity of their processes, making it essential to continuously evaluate and improve internal operations. One such process, the annual inventory count within the central purchasing department, recently came under scrutiny for its inefficiency.\nHistorically, the inventory counting process was a labor-intensive task. It required the collaboration of eight employees working full-time over a span of three weeks. This not only consumed significant human resources but also represented a substantial opportunity cost, as these employees were diverted from other critical tasks.\nRecognizing the inefficiency, I took the initiative to analyze and re-engineer the process. Through the development of a tailored script, I was able to transform the operation entirely. What once took weeks and considerable manpower could now be accomplished with a single click, completing the entire inventory count in just four minutes.\nThe impact of this improvement cannot be overstated. By reducing the time and resources required for inventory counting, we have not only increased productivity but also freed up valuable personnel to focus on other strategic initiatives. This change represents a significant leap forward in operational efficiency, showcasing the power of technology in streamlining business processes.\nThis case exemplifies the importance of continually reassessing and optimizing business operations.
