Building a sim racing wheel is a highly complex endeavor that demands both technical expertise and creative craftsmanship. From design to material selection and electronic integration—every detail is meticulously planned to ensure the ultimate driving experience.

Design and Construction
The first step in developing a sim racing wheel is the design process, where Fusion 360 software plays a crucial role. This powerful tool allows for the creation of three-dimensional models of the wheel, enabling precise and efficient design. Throughout this project, significant proficiency in using Fusion 360 was acquired, forming the backbone of the entire construction process.

Materials: Carbon and Aluminum
Only the highest quality materials were chosen for the wheel's construction. The frame is made of carbon fiber, renowned for its lightness and exceptional strength. The buttons and shifters were crafted from aluminum, providing a durable and stylish solution. This combination of carbon and aluminum not only grants the wheel outstanding stability but also a premium aesthetic.

Ergonomics Through 3D Scanning
Ergonomics is a central consideration in designing a sim racing wheel. To ensure optimal handling, the wheel's ergonomic features were developed using 3D scanning technology. This technique allowed for the wheel to be shaped in a way that perfectly conforms to the driver’s hands, guaranteeing a comfortable and immersive driving experience.

Software and Electronics
Beyond the physical construction, integrating electronics and software is a crucial aspect of the project. The wheel’s controls were precisely programmed to ensure fast and reliable responses. The electronic components were carefully selected and integrated to provide seamless connectivity between the wheel and the simulation software.

Thus, building a sim racing wheel is more than just a technical project—it is a harmonious blend of design, materials science, ergonomics, and electronics. The expertise gained in Fusion 360 was pivotal to the project's success, resulting in a custom-made wheel that meets the highest standards and delivers an exceptional driving experience.
