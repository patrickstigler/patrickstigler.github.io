### Project Overview

As the **leader of a Hackathon Challenge**, I took full responsibility for the **planning, preparation, and execution** of the event. The objective of the challenge was to develop a **low-cost alternative to traditional industrial robotic arms** that could perform simple tasks. The project was built on an **Open-Source design**, which I adapted to our specific use case using **CAD software**.

Ahead of the event, I built a **fully functional prototype** to validate both the design and functionality of the robotic arms. Given the tight timeline during the hackathon, I ensured that the necessary **3D-printed parts** were produced in advance, as 3D printing would have taken several days.

### Responsibilities and Preparation

To ensure the success of the robotic arms and the efficient execution of the hackathon, I was responsible for the following areas:

- **Prototyping and Material Preparation**: Developed a functional prototype to **validate the design** before the hackathon.
- **3D Printing and Component Fabrication**: Produced all **3D printed parts** ahead of time to adhere to the strict time constraints during the hackathon.
- **Specialized Hardware Components**: Procured and manufactured custom components, such as **sliding bearings**, to ensure the mechanical functionality of the robotic arms.

### Execution and Team Leadership

During the hackathon, I organized and led **three separate teams**, each working on parallel workflows to develop the robotic arms. These teams relied upon proven Open-Source solutions from a variety of fields:

- **Software and Kinematics**: Leveraged **Open-Source projects** for calculating the armâ€™s kinematics.
- **Electronics**: Integrated **Open-Hardware solutions** typically used in CNC milling machines to build the control systems for the robots.

By strategically combining Open-Source software and hardware with custom-built components, the project was successfully completed on time and met all expectations.

### Results and Challenge Success

The challenge's goal of developing an affordable robotic solution was efficiently and successfully achieved. The key outcomes include:

- **Cost-Efficient Robotic Arms**: Developed three functional robotic arms that serve as a **cost-effective alternative** to far more expensive industrial options.
- **Effective Use of Open Source**: Through the **strategic use of open-source software** and custom hardware solutions, the project met its budget while maintaining high quality and performance.
- **Efficient Team Leadership**: Managing three parallel teams led to the on-time and high-quality completion of the robotic arms.
