### Project Overview

As the **project lead** and **person fully responsible for the implementation**, I developed an **innovative meeting room booking system** with **3D visualization** and **automated hardware integration**. The goal of the project was to create a modern and intuitive system that enhances both the digital and physical management of meeting rooms.

To achieve this, an **interactive display** was installed at the **entrance area**, showcasing a **3D model of the building** developed in collaboration with a **game design studio**. This model visualizes the **booking status of all rooms in real-time**. Users can also **book spontaneous meetings** directly on-site via the **touchscreen interface**.

### Solution Approach: Software and Hardware Integration

I was fully responsible for the **planning**, **development**, and **execution** of the system. Key aspects of the solution included:

- **3D Visualization**: A detailed **3D model of the building** was created in collaboration with a game design studio, providing **an intuitive view** of room availability.
- **Interactive Room Booking**: Users could **book meetings spontaneously** via the **touchscreen**, selecting available rooms from the 3D model in real time.
- **Automated Room Occupancy Detection**: Integration of **hardware** that automatically **detects room occupancy** and provides updates to the system in real time.

### Results

The implementation of the innovative meeting room booking system led to optimized room management processes and a more intuitive way of managing meeting spaces. Key outcomes include:

- **Improved Efficiency in Room Utilization**: With **automatic room detection** and **real-time visualization**, unbooked or blocked rooms were significantly reduced.
- **User-Friendly Booking Interface**: The **intuitive 3D model** and **touchscreen interface** allowed users to quickly and easily reserve rooms, greatly speeding up the process of organizing meetings on the spot.
- **Technology Integration**: The combination of **software development** and **hardware integration** ensured a seamless solution that worked in real time without requiring manual intervention.
