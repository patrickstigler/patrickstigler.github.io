### Success Story at Robert Bosch GmbH, Stuttgart

I led the development of a cutting-edge desk sensor device designed to monitor key environmental factors such as air quality, temperature, humidity, and noise levels. In addition to these capabilities, the sensor is equipped to detect desk occupancy by analyzing USB or HDMI connections. This dual functionality significantly enhances both workspace efficiency and occupant comfort.

By leveraging advanced predictive models, we analyze the data collected by the desk sensor to estimate office occupancy patterns. These insights are crucial for optimizing space planning and resource allocation, ensuring that office environments are not only more comfortable but also more efficiently managed.

This project underscores the potential of smart technology to transform workplace management, driving improvements in both operational efficiency and employee well-being.
