### Success Story at Robert Bosch GmbH, Stuttgart

I led a pioneering project involving the development and implementation of Pax Countersâ€”small devices that track MAC addresses from Wi-Fi and Bluetooth signals to estimate foot traffic. This innovative technology allows for the precise collection of data regarding the number and movement of people within a specific area.

By analyzing this data, we can accurately predict the flow of visitors, which is particularly beneficial in canteens. The insights gained help in planning the required amount of food more accurately, leading to a significant reduction in food waste while simultaneously enhancing operational efficiency.

The deployment of Pax Counters represents a crucial step towards more sustainable and efficient management of public facilities, saving costs and improving the overall customer experience.
