### Project Overview

In my role as a **Consultant**, I played an active part in an **innovation project** that aimed to **revolutionize driving schools**. The concept of the project was to develop a **driving simulator** that would **reduce the cost of driving lessons** while providing the opportunity to simulate **critical driving situations** that cannot typically be replicated using traditional methods. The ultimate goal was to increase both the **safety** and **effectiveness** of driver training.

My primary focus in the project was on the **design and development of the simulator's hardware**, which served as the foundation for the system's operation. As part of the project team, we experimented with **existing simulation engines** to define the key **hardware requirements** for the final product.

### Solution Approach

My role in the project involved focusing on several key tasks:

- **Core Design of the Simulator**: Developing the **hardware structure** necessary to create a realistic driving simulation, including selecting components for steering, pedals, and display screens.
- **Experimentation with Simulation Engines**: During the initial phase, we tested various **simulation engines** to evaluate their ability to realistically replicate the **complexity of driving** and integrate with the hardware setup.
- **Focus on Critical Situations**: A particular emphasis was placed on the simulator's ability to **reproduce critical driving scenarios**, such as sudden obstacles, hazardous weather conditions, or complex traffic situations. These scenarios are often difficult or impossible to safely simulate in real driving practice.
