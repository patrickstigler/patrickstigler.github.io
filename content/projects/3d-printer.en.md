Building a 3D printer from scratch requires a deep understanding of the intricate processes involved in 3D printing. This expertise enabled the design and construction of a custom 3D printer, perfectly tailored to meet specific needs.

Design and Construction
The process began with a detailed design that took into account all aspects of 3D printing. From material selection to the integration of mechanics, every component was meticulously planned and executed. The result is a custom-built printer that excels in both functionality and performance.

Software and Mechanics
In addition to the physical construction, software played a crucial role. The control software was developed to precisely manage the printer's mechanics, including axis calibration, extruder control, and the adjustment of printing parameters to achieve optimal results.
