### Project Overview

As part of this project, I conducted a comprehensive **evaluation of remote maintenance systems CAP and XMReality**. The primary objective was to identify systems that enable less technically skilled individuals to receive **expert assistance with large machinery and equipment**. Special focus was placed on **remote and difficult-to-reach locations**, such as **cargo ships**.

In these environments, on-site technical experts are rarely available, making **remote expert support** crucial. A major challenge was that **network connections on ships** are often **slow and unstable**, creating obstacles for effective remote maintenance assistance.

### Solution: Efficient Evaluation under Limited Network Conditions

The evaluation focused specifically on testing how well the systems performed under conditions typical of cargo ships. This included:

- **Support for less technical teams**: Both systems needed to allow **step-by-step guidance** by international experts to provide fast responses to on-site issues.
- **Efficiency with unstable networks**: A critical aspect we evaluated was how well the systems worked even when internet connections were **slow or unreliable**.

Following the evaluation, key requirements were met:

- **Low bandwidth requirements**: Both systems required relatively low bandwidth and performed reliably, even with **unstable network conditions**.
- **Real-time support**: CAP and XMReality both enabled **near real-time communication** under challenging network setups, ensuring effective remote maintenance.

### Results

Key findings from the system evaluation include:

- **Global reach for remote maintenance**: Both systems allowed for global expert support of **technicians with limited technical expertise**, greatly improving on-site efficiency.
- **Dependability in restricted networks**: Particularly when dealing with slow and unstable internet connections on cargo ships, the systems demonstrated their **resilience**, ensuring **reliable maintenance in critical situations**.
- **Real-time expert connectivity**: Both CAP and XMReality provided **instant access to expert knowledge**, reducing downtime and speeding up troubleshooting.

### Conclusion

The evaluation of **CAP** and **XMReality** in the context of **remote maintenance on cargo ships** under limited network conditions was a complete success. Both systems met the requirements for **efficient data transmission** and **stable communication channels**, even in low-bandwidth scenarios. This provides a robust solution for the **global application of remote maintenance** for large-scale equipment and allows **less technically skilled personnel** to be guided quickly and accurately by international experts, even in critical situations.
