### Success Story: LoRaWAN Technology Revolutionizes Sensor Monitoring in Facility Management

As the project lead for a strategic collaboration project with the **Facility Management** team, I was responsible for introducing the **LoRaWAN standard** across multiple locations in Germany. The goal was to implement a smart, automated solution for the **CO₂ gas cylinder monitoring**. In addition, the system was designed to be modular, allowing future expansion to monitor other **environmental parameters** – from temperature to humidity – facilitating preemptive maintenance planning.

#### Challenge

Before the LoRaWAN implementation, Facility Management was dealing with outdated, manual solutions that resulted in high maintenance costs and unreliable outcomes. Moreover, there was no **scalable, flexible system** available to easily integrate future **IoT expansions**.

**Key challenges included:**
- Automating the monitoring processes for **CO₂ gas cylinders**
- Building a scalable system infrastructure for future IoT uses
- Reducing maintenance costs and **network fees**
- Providing transparent, **real-time data processing** without manual logs

#### Solution

The solution focused on the integration of a **customizable and future-proof LoRaWAN system**. As the **Project Lead**, I oversaw the following key tasks:

1. **Signal Strength Measurements**: Identifying optimal locations for gateways to ensure maximum network coverage.
   
2. **Gateway Placement Consulting**: Strategic positioning to minimize network gaps and maximize performance.
   
3. **Selection of Backend System and Communication Protocols**: Ensuring an efficient, scalable backend for reliable data collection and communication over the LoRaWAN network.
   
4. **Software Management**: After the Facility Management team installed the gateways, I took over the software administration to ensure smooth data management and system integration.
