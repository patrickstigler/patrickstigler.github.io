### Project Overview

As the **lead coordinator**, I was responsible for the conceptualization and planning of a state-of-the-art **Makerspace** dedicated to **Rapid Prototyping**, **Media Technologies**, **Virtual Reality (VR)**, and **Augmented Reality (AR)**. This space was designed to support innovative projects, creating a dedicated environment where ideas could be quickly transformed into tangible results. A key milestone in this initiative was the successful acquisition of a **free 3D printer from Dremel**, significantly expanding our prototyping capabilities.

### Key Results

The success of the original Makerspace gained **international recognition**. A second site abroad recognized the value and impact of the lab and expressed interest in **replicating the model**. Given my experience, I was entrusted with the **leadership of developing and planning the new Makerspace** at this additional location.

**Key outcomes** of the project and expansion phase included:

- **Enhanced Prototyping Capabilities**: The acquisition of **3D printers** and the establishment of the materials library allowed for rapid and efficient project execution.
- **Strengthened Collaborations with Universities**: The partnerships provided access to the **latest technologies** and **research outcomes**, especially in the fields of VR and AR.
- **Successful Expansion**: By **replicating and adapting** the original Makerspace model, we established a customized lab that effectively supports the needs of the new site.
- **International Recognition**: The development of the second Makerspace further solidified our **global presence** and **reputation** as leaders in **technological innovation**.
