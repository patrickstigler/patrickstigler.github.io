### Project Overview

As the project lead for a Hackathon challenge, I was responsible for the **planning**, **conceptualizing**, and **execution** of a challenge focused on **integrating innovative technologies** into daily operations. The main focus of the challenge was on leveraging **Microsoft Hololens** in the **vehicle diagnostics process**, using Augmented Reality to significantly improve diagnostic efficiency and precision.

The project I developed focused on linking the Hololens to the vehicleâ€™s **CAN-bus system** to simplify and expedite **fault detection**. Augmented Reality was used to project the **faulty part directly onto the vehicle**, allowing both the customer and the mechanic to instantly identify the precise location of the component.

### Solution Approach: Leveraging Augmented Reality

The project was built on the smart fusion of **CAN-bus data** and **Augmented Reality**, presenting a revolutionary approach to vehicle diagnostics. The solution's key features included:

- **Microsoft Hololens Integration**: Connecting the **Hololens to the CAN-bus** system of the vehicle to retrieve fault codes and relevant diagnostic data.
- **Augmented Reality Overlay**: The **faulty component was projected in real time** onto the vehicle, allowing for quick and precise localization.
- **Additional Information Display**: The AR overlay also provided **additional information about the component**, including **repair guides and an order option** for the faulty part.

The challenge aimed to create an **intuitive and user-friendly solution** that benefits both customers and mechanics, optimizing the maintenance process of vehicles.
