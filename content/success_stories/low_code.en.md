date: 2022-08-01
draft: false
summary: "By implementing a future-proof Low-Code platform, both professional developers and Citizen Developers were empowered to efficiently build applications. The platform resulted in a remarkable 80% efficiency increase and saved approximately €4.2 million in the first year."
---
### Project Overview

As part of the "Low-Code" project, an evaluation of the top Low-Code platforms based on the **Gartner analysis** was conducted to find a solution that serves both professional developers and **Citizen Developers**. Particular focus was placed on notable platforms such as **Thingworx**, **Mendix**, and **OutSystems**, with the ultimate goal of identifying the best solution for a **wide range of application scenarios**, from simple Excel alternatives to complex applications.

The project's primary objective was to enable **Citizen Developers** to create their own applications, while simultaneously improving the productivity of professional developers by leveraging **Low-Code technology** and **integrated deployment pipelines**. These pipelines allow developers to build and release applications directly—eliminating additional deployment steps.

### Solution

To further boost collaboration and productivity, **pre-built templates** were developed and integrated, allowing for rapid sharing of application concepts within teams. Additionally, the platform was designed to adhere to corporate-specific **design guidelines**, ensuring a consistent and user-friendly interface. Key actions included:

- **Minimum Viable Product (MVP) Rollout**: The MVP was deployed in a **test environment** with 50 test users.
- **Infrastructure and External Data Sources**: Integration with external data sources such as **SAP** and various databases was successfully executed.
- **Scalability Tests**: Extensive scalability testing was conducted to ensure the platform is future-proof and can adapt to growing demand.

### Support and Role-based Access Control

An integral part of the project was the development of a comprehensive **support concept**, which included both a **user-helping-user community** as well as **team support by developers**. This support system enabled users to quickly resolve issues and assist each other. Additionally, an **offshore team** implemented a **role-based authorization concept**, efficiently managing user access and permissions. A **workflow system** was also integrated to simplify the management of user roles and access rights.

---

### Challenges and Scaling

Throughout the project, the user count grew faster than anticipated, leading to a **temporary overload** of the test system. This required a **registration freeze** to maintain system stability. To provide users with an easy onboarding process, a detailed **training program** was developed, supported by regular **workshops** for users.

---

### Results

The platform achieved remarkable success early after the rollout. The number of **active users** grew rapidly:

- **Directly after the test phase**: 650 users.
- **Shortly after the official launch**: 1,100 active users.

With an estimated **efficiency increase of about 80%**, we expect **savings of approximately €4.2 million** in the first year, based on the average development costs for 250 developers. Given the continually growing user base, these savings are projected to rise exponentially, leading to significant **cost reductions and productivity gains** for the company.

---

### Conclusion

The **Low-Code project** was a pivotal step in the company's **digitalization** and **process optimization** efforts. It empowers Citizen Developers to create applications across varying complexities while also freeing up professional developers by offering **pre-built templates, automation, and integrated deployment pipelines**. The project has not only driven substantial improvements in **efficiency** but also contributed to significant **cost savings** for the company.
